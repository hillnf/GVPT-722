Please read all of the questions and tables carefully. Be as brief as possible; extra calculations and incorrect information, even in the presence of correct information, will result in point deductions. If you need to make any assumptions, be sure to make them explicit. Show all formulas and all work.

## Question 1

Imagine you hypothesize that the probability of supporting a law to lower the voting age to 16 is lower for people age 65 and older than it is for people 31-64 years old. Using the table of survey results below answer questions 1a, 1b, and 1c. Please show all of your work.

| Age          | Oppose | Support | TOTAL |
|--------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 18-29        | 75     | 125     | 200   |
| 30-64        | 250    | 250     | 500   |
| 65 and older | 200    | 100     | 300   |
| TOTAL        | 525    | 475     | 1000  |

: Probability of Supporting a Law to Lower the Voting Age to 16 by Age (cell counts)

### Part A

What is the probability of supporting the law? (1 point)

**Answer:**

The probability of supporting the law is 475/1000 or 47.5 %

### Part B

What is the probability of being 18-29 **or** supporting the law? Write the general (i.e. using symbols) formula you used to obtain your answer and show all of your work. (2 points)

**Answer:**

P(A + B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

P(A) is person being aged 18-29

P(A and B) is person supporting the law

P(A and B) is voting for the supporting the law and are 18-29

200 + 475 - 125 = 550 so, 550/1000 = 55.0% support the law or are 18-29

### Part C

In terms of the substantive results (ignore statistical significance), does the evidence support your hypothesis? Explain, using details, how you know (no more than 2 sentences). (5 points)

**Answer:**

The results suggest a support for our hypothesis as 50% (250/500) of people aged 30-64 support the law while as only a third of voters aged older than 65 support a law lowering the voting age to 16.

## Question 2

Provide a political science example of an ordered categorical variable. (1 point)

**Answer:**

American Political Party Affiliation (i.e Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, etc.) is a categorical variable.

## Question 3

A recent study by Dr. Doofenshmirtz found that those who were randomly selected to be exposed to arguments that 16- and 17-year-olds are informed and engaged in local politics increased support for lowering the voting age to 16 by 10 percentage points, from a baseline of support of 45 percentage points in the control condition. On a quantitative methods exam Zuri, Jesse, and Teddy were asked if the effect was substantively significant. The question they were asked did not give any information about statistical significance. The answers they provided follow.

Jesse: The effect is substantively significant because 10 is a large number.

Teddy: We just don't know because there isn't any information about statistical significance.

Zuri: The effect is substantively significant because this information increases support over 50%, so a campaign stressing these points could help the policy pass by getting more than 50% support.

### Part A

True or False. Jesse would be marked incorrect. Just state True or False. (1 point)

**Answer:**

False

### Part B

True or False. Teddy would be marked as correct. Just state True or False. (1 point)

**Answer:**

False

### Part C

**True** or False. Zuri would be marked as correct. Just state True or False. (1 point)

**Answer:**

True

## Question 4

Use the information below and in Table 2 to answer questions 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d.

**Dependent variable:**

-   United Nations Feeling Thermometer ranging from 0 (coldest) to 100 (warmest)

**Independent variables:**

-   Female, coded 1 for female and 0 for male;

-   Age, coded in years from 16-90.

The following results were obtained from a survey of 2,500 individuals age 16 to 90 in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America, and Africa.

| Independent variables | Coefficient | p-value |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------|
| Constant              | 51          | 0.000   |
| Female                | 2           | 0.000   |
| Age                   | 0.4         | 0.000   |

: Regression Results for Q4

### Part A

Using the information above, determine whether the following statement is **True or False, and fully explain why** in no more than 1 sentence: The interpretation of the coefficient on the constant term is useful on its own. (4 points)

**Answer:**

True, The coefficient is useful on its own because it accounts for the UN male thermometer rating.

### Part B

Using the information above, what is the substantive meaning of the coefficient on the Female variable? Answer in no more than 1 sentence and be sure to tailor the answer to the variables used in this example. (2 points)

**Answer:**

The female UN thermometer rating is on average 2 points higher than the male, holding all else else constant.

### Part C

True or False. Using the information above, because the coefficient on Female is larger than the coefficient on Age, the effect of being female on the United Nations Feeling thermometer is larger than the effect of age. Just state True or **False**. (1 point)

**Answer:**

False

### Part D

Using the information above, might the positive coefficient on Age be the result of older people being more knowledgeable about the United Nations? In no more than 1 sentence, explain your answer. (3 points)

**Answer:**

Yes, the positive coefficient shows that older might have more positive feelings towards the UN but we cannot definitively claim that they are more knowledgeable.

## Question 5

### Part A

In an OLS model that includes X~2~, X~3~, and an interaction between X~2~ and X~3~, in one sentence explain how you would test the **overall** statistical significance of the relationship between X~2~ and the dependent variable. That is, what test would be used and what is the null hypothesis? (2 points)

**Answer:**

We would use an F - Test to test the relationship between X2 and the DV, with the null hypothesis being X2 = 0.

### Part B

Write out the equation for the effect of X~2~ on Y from the following OLS model:

**Y = β~1~ + β~2~X~2~ + β~3~X~3~ + β~23~X~2\*~X~3~ + β~4~X~4~ + u.** (3 points)

**Answer:**

Y = β~2~ + β~23~X~2\*~X~3~

### Part C

Using the equation in 5b, if **X~2~** is a dummy variable coded as 0 or 1 and **X**~3~ is a categorical variable coded as 1, 2, or 3, is it useful to interpret **β~2~** on its own? **If it is not useful** to do so explain why it is not.  **If it is useful** to do so explain what it reveals.  Answer in [no more than 2 sentences]{.underline}. (3 points)

**Answer:**

β~2~ represents the effect of X~2~ on Y when X~3~ is zero which would be impossible since X~3~ is a categorical variable ( coded as 1,2 or 3), so it would not be particularity useful to code it on its own.

## Question 6

True or False. When using panel data, one of the key issues to address is the lack of independence across the observations. Just state True or False. (1 point)

**Answer:**

True

## Question 7

Answer the questions below based on the following information and the following table. (8 points total)

**Data**: 2020, individual level U.S. survey data

**Method**: Probit

**Dependent Variable**:

-   Voted or not, coded as `1` for voted and `0` for did not vote

**Independent Variables**:

-   Age (coded 18-92);

-   Education (coded in 5 categories (1 = No high school degree, 5 = Graduate Degree));

-   South (state is in the south and was part of the confederacy or not, 1=state is in the south, 0=state is not in the south).

| Independent variables | Coefficient   | Std. error | z-value | p-value |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------|---------|---------|
| Constant              | -3.79         | 0.04       | -94.75  | 0.000   |
| Age                   | 0.04          | 0.00       | 100.00  | 0.000   |
| Education             | 0.48          | 0.23       | 2.05    | 0.04    |
| South                 | -0.40         | 0.16       | 1.88    | 0.030   |
|                       |               |            |         |         |
| N                     | = 98,857      |            |         |         |
| Log likelihood        | = -56,089.376 |            |         |         |
| Chi sq                | = 13,196      |            |         |         |

: Probability of Voting Results for Q7

### Part A

Interpret the coefficient on the South variable (3 points)

**Answer:**

While we can directly interpert the coefficient in terms probiability of the outcome as we would in a linear regression, the south's coefficient of -.40 this suggests a decrease in the z-score of this probit model. In other words we can expect that individuals living in the south are less likely to vote holding education and age constant compared to the non-south

### Part B

In terms of the probability of voting, how you would determine the effect of living in a state that is in the south (which would allow you to then assess substantive significance)? That is, what is the effect of changing the South variable from 0 to 1?  Set up all relevant equations **COMPLETELY** (but do not solve them), briefly explain what each does (no more than 1 sentence each), and explain how the effect of South is obtained (no more than 1 sentence). Note that this is **not** asking you to address substantive significance, just to set up the process. (5 points)

**Answer:**

1.  First we used the Probit Model Equation
    1.  P(Y = 1\|X) = Φ (Xβ) -
2.  Then we write out the equations to get the predicted probability, accounting for the two scenarios of voting when in the south and not in the south:
    1.  P (Y \|South = 1) = β0 + β1(age) + β2(Education) +β3 + 0\*south
        1.  With the coefficients added it would be:
            1.  P = -3.79 + .04(Age) + 0.48(Education) + 0\*south
    2.  P (Y \|South = 0) = β0 + β1(age) + β2(Education) +β3\* 1
        1.  With the coefficients added it would be:
            1.  P = -3.79 + .04(Age) + 0.48(Education) -.40\*south
3.  The we compute for the marginal effects of being in the south
    1.  ME(South) = P (Y \|South = 1) - P (Y \|South = 0)

## Bonus question

### Part A

True or False. If you run an OLS model and a test shows that the variance of the errors increases as one of the independent variables increases, i.e., there is heteroscedasticity, then the coefficients are unbiased but the standard errors are biased. Just state True or False. (1 point)

**Answer:**

False

### Part B

What is the OLS estimate of Y = α + ε? (That is, what does the OLS estimate of α equal?) (1 point)

**Answer:**

α is the sample mean of Y

### Part C

Define consistency as it relates to a property of estimators. (2 points)

**Answer:**

Consistency is in terms of estimator means that an estimator's accuracy increases with an increase in sample size.
