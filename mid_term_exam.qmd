## Question 1

Imagine you hypothesize that the probability of voting for the incumbent in a two-candidate race is higher for people age 30 and older. Using the table of survey results below answer questions 1a, 1b, and 1c. Please show all of your work.

| Age          | Challenger | Incumbent | TOTAL |
|--------------|------------|-----------|-------|
| 18-29        | 300        | 100       | 400   |
| 30 and older | 500        | 100       | 600   |
| TOTAL        | 800        | 200       | 1000  |

: Voting for the Incumbent and Challenger by Age (cell counts)

### Part A

What is the probability of voting for the incumbent? (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**Answer:**

Incumbent/Total = Probability of voting for incumbent, therefore 200/1000 = .20; so the probability of voting for the incumbent is predicted to be 20%.

### Part B

What is the probability of being 18-29 **or** voting for the incumbent? Write the general (i.e. using symbols) formula you used to obtain your answer and show all of your work. (2 points)

::: callout-note
0/3
:::

**Answer:**

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B), therefore 400/1000 + 200/1000 = .6; so the probability of being 18-29 or having voted for the incumbent would predicted to be 60%.

::: callout-note
$$
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\&B)
$$

The answer is 0.5.
:::

### Part C

In terms of the substantive results (ignore statistical significance), does the evidence support your hypothesis? Explain, using details, how you know (no more than 2 sentences). (5 points)

::: callout-note
4/5
:::

**Answer:**

The results does not support the hypothesis because while the same number voted for the incumbent in both ages groups, the total number of 18-29 votes (400) is less than the total number of 30 or older voters (600).

::: callout-note
The relative raw count does not help us understand.
:::

This meaning that a greater proportion of people aged 18-29 voted for the incumbent than those aged 30 or older, therefore showing less support for the proposed hypothesis.

## Question 2

A recent poll of 500 likely Republican voters includes 200 "highly educated" respondents and 300 "poorly educated" respondents. Both groups supported Donald Trump at the same rate. If you were to construct confidence intervals around these estimates, would the confidence interval be larger around the highly educated or poorly educated? Why? Answer in no more than one sentence. (2 points)

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

**Answer:**

The smaller the sample size the larger the confidence interval, so the "highly educated" would be larger given they have a smaller sample.

## Question 3

Provide a political science example of a continuous variable. (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**Answer:**

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a given country

## Question 4

Use the information that follows to respond to the questions that come after **Table 2**.

The OLS regression results in **Table 2** were obtained from a survey of 1,500 citizens age 16 to 90 in European Union member nations. The p-values are from 2 tailed tests of significance.

**Dependent variable**:

-   European Parliament Feeling Thermometer ranging from 0 (coldest) to 100 (warmest).

**Independent variables**:Â 

-   Female: coded as equal to `1` for females and equal to `0` otherwise.

-   Education: coded as equal to `1` for those with 0 years of education, coded as equal to `2` for those with 1-8 years of education, coded as equal to `3` for those with 9-11 years of education, and coded as equal to `4` for those with 12 or more years of education.

| Independent variable | Coefficient | P-value |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| Constant             | 3           | 0.000   |
| Female               | -7          | 0.000   |
| Education            | 20          | 0.070   |

: Regression results

### Part A

In the context described above, is it useful to interpret the coefficient on the constant term on its own? If it is not useful to do so explain why it is not. If it is useful to do so explain what it reveals. Answer in no more than 2 sentences. (3 points)

**Answer:**

::: callout-note
1/3
:::

The constant on its own is not a particularly useful in itself as it is unlikely that we would have zero for both variables in the real world. Out of the 1,500 European citizens surveyed it would be unusual to find no women or people with 0 years of education.

::: callout-note
Education cannot equal 0. We do have a zero for `female`.
:::

### Part B

Is the result for education statistically significant at the 5% error level? Answer **YES** or **NO** (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**Answer:**

No

### Part C

Will a 95% confidence interval around the coefficient for education include 0? Answer **YES** or **NO** (1 point)

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**Answer:**

Yes

### Part D

What is the substantive meaning of the coefficient on the education variable (i.e. interpret the coefficient estimate)? Answer in one sentence. (3 points)

::: callout-note
2/3
:::

**Answer:**

For every increase in education of those survey on average the thermometer score will increase by 20 all else held constant.

::: callout-note
Increase of how much education?
:::

### Part F

Based on the results in **Table 2**, might the negative coefficient on `Female` be the result of females having less access to education? In no more than 1 sentence, explain your answer. (3 points)

::: callout-note
2/3
:::

**Answer:**

Since the variables are accounted for separately in this regression test we cannot make the claim that education has an effect on the thermometer ratings of those female's surveyed.

::: callout-note
We can claim that a female's level of education has an effect on their feelings towards the EP.

A recent study by Dr. Doofenshmirtz found that an in-class presentation on voting from a fellow student increased the rate of voter registration among high school students in the U.S. by 3 percentage points. On a quantitative methods exam Zuri, Jesse, and Teddy were asked if the effect was substantively significant. The question they were asked did not give any information about statistical significance. The answers they provided follow.

Zuri: The effect is not substantively significant because the rate of registration among high school students is very low and even with a 3 percentage point increase will be low and lower than in other democracies.

Jesse: We just don't know because there isn't any information about statistical significance.

Teddy: The effect is substantively significant because in a close election, the additional people who registered could change the outcome.

Which of the following provides the best evaluation of the above answers?

A.  Jesse would be marked as correct, and the others as incorrect

B.  Teddy would be marked as correct, and the others as incorrect

C.  Zuri would be marked as correct, and the others as incorrect

D.  Zuri and Jesse would both be marked correct, and Teddy as incorrect

E.  **Zuri and Teddy would both be marked correct, and Jesse as incorrect**
